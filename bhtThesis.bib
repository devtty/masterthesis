   abstract = {In this paper we propose a centralized web firewall system for web application security which will provide a new type of synchronized system, which has the ability to&nbsp; detect&nbsp; and prevent a variety of web application attacks for a wide range of hosts at the same time , using an centralized command and control system, the attacked client then sends the information to a centralized command and control server which will distribute the attack information to all of the integrated clients connected to it. The distributed information contains all of the attack information including the type of attack, the IP address of the attacker, and the time of attack. The process of receiving the attacker&#39;s information and distributing it through the centralized web firewall is done automatically and immediately at the time of the attack. And all of the receiving clients will take actions against the threat depending on the distributed information such as banning the IP address of the attacker. The main process aims to protect multiple clients from any possible attack from the same attacker or the same type of attack. The system has been implemented to protect a real web application. Experiments showed that the attacks has been successfully prevented on multiple hosts at the time.  This paper came to provide a centralized web firewall system that connect different web firewalls in order to detect and prevent different types of web attacks and work as a fully integrated system with the different clients.},

@inproceedings{kozik2019,
   abstract = {Currently, we can observe that vulnerable web pages are a common element in many high-profile cyberattacks. On the other hand, web applications (as well as web services) have become an inherent element of many supply chains. In order to protect the web services against some of the cyberattacks, one can adapt web application firewalls (WAF) solutions. However, quite often a challenge for typical WAF software is the fact that HTTP can be used as transport by other protocols or as a mix of other various encoding techniques. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a flexible schema for automated application layer request structure identification. Our experiments show that this technique allows us to further improve the effectiveness of known detection methods used in this research domain. In this paper, we show the possible practical application of the proposed cybersecurity solution in the public domain, namely public administration web-based systems and healthcare sectors. From the scientific point of view, we presented the results of various classifiers and pattern extraction techniques. We have also addressed the possible deployment of the proposed solution in Big Data-enabled environments.},
